title: Python and Jupyter Installation instructions 
---


Python is a popular language for research computing, and great for
general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its research
packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we
recommend Anaconda, an all-in-one installer.  Regardless of how you
choose to install it, make sure you install Python version 2.7.

We will use the Jupyter  programming
environment that runs in a web browser extensively. For this to work you will need
a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome,
Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported (some older browsers,
including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).
